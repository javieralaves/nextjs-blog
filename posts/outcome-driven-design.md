Over the past few years, it's been inspiring to see and experience fundamental changes in the way we build digital products, and in this post I want to cover what I believe is at the foundation of this change: outcome-driven design.

Great companies have known these principles for a while; in fact the concepts are far from new. They are rooted in models that have existed for decades. And it's only within the past few years that they have resurfaced back to conversation. So what's changed?

## The context is different

Software as a service has taken off as a mature business model that's disrupted most, if not all industries. Software is eating the world, and now that executing on creativity is easier than ever, what actually matters is to prioritize our efforts.

Not too long ago, the ability to design a mobile app or a website was restricted to those with programming knowledge on top of very technical frameworks. But what tools like Figma and Webflow are doing is becoming an interface for code, executed to the extent that the abilities that were once restricted to a few are now democratized to a wider audience of creators.

As a result, there are more software businesses than ever, increasingly competing and iterating at the speed of software, many of which are leveraging outcome-driven design in niche markets to grow and scale.

## Solving for outcomes over features

Outcome-driven design is a focus shift from features (the output of product design) to business outcomes (increased revenue, reduced costs.)

In essence, through outcome-driven design you first identify the business outcomes you want to achieve. Once you're clear on the outcomes, the next step is to figure out what user behavior actually has an effect on improving those outcomes; this is the focal point of observation for this methodology.

In consequence, outcome-driven projects that are directed at these specific user behaviors will inherently be optimized for business results.

## Not simply job stories

Job stories (or jobs to be done) is a well known framework that helps teams formulate features under a given context, and for a given purpose or motivation. It generally goes something like this: When (situation), the user wants to (motivation), so that (outcome).

Job stories are great at decoupling a motivation from a user's desired outcome, and while they do unlock deeper level product thinking, they don't fully encapsulate what it means to execute outcome-driven design.

## Adopting outcome-driven design

**Start small.** The best way to get started is to start small, pick one project within your product where you and your team are comfortable experimenting.

**Work backwards.** Instead of looking at your backlog of features and trying to reason through which ones will have the most impact to your business' bottom line, work backwards from the outcome instead and ask yourself: "What combination of features and enhancements will drive the business impact I'm after?"

**Translate outcomes to user behavior.** Of course, this question is too broad and doesn't lead to any productive efforts, which is why you need to make outcomes measurable and translatable into specific user behavior. Once you're able to do that, the question becomes a little clearer: "What combination of features and enhancements will drive *this user behavior*?"

At Netflix for example, they defined a proxy metric based on their product analytics and insights that associates long-term user retention with just two-week retention. The outcome is user retention in the form of secured revenue over time; the user behavior that's acted upon to improve by product design teams however is two-week retention.

## Leaps of faith

Of course, you won't necessarily know straight away what kind of user behavior drives business results. Even for companies like Netflix, it takes months to observe and make any meaningful hypotheses. Good news is, it's perfectly fine to not know.

More often than not, it's going to take a leap of faith for you and your team to figure out whether 1) you've captured the right problem, and 2) whether the solution you've shipped will have any bottom line consequences.

Plus, it takes practice to get it right. Your first few outcome-driven projects will go just fine; what's important is that you plan retrospectives to be thoughtful about your learnings and improve over time.

## Feature-driven projects

All things said, outcome-driven design is not an all or nothing methodology. You can still, and should have feature-driven projects as well.

Feature-driven projects come from customers' feature requests, product gaps identified by your sales team in attempts to close deals, or big new ideas that your team is excited about.

Under a feature-driven approach, the focal point of observation lies on the customer's problem. Beyond that, it's hard to determine whether the problem itself will be significant to drive business results at scale, but at least you're delivering on expectations and potentially unblocking more creative ideas in the near future.

## Delivering delightfulness

Delightful user experience comes to life when your customers are able to obtain unprecedented value from your product. This is the result of having a deep empathy for your user's needs, and knowing how to translate those needs into solutions that beat their expectation.

I believe outcome-driven projects will, by design, deliver on more delightfulness over time, because the methodology forces you to take a step back from building just any feature, and instead focus on the stuff that people are truly willing to pay for. This is not necessarily always related to delighting people, but it's a good proxy.

It's also possible to deliver delightfulness through feature-driven projects, but most times it'll still require you to take a step back from the specific request at hand and break the feedback down into outcomes that the user's ultimately after.

## The bigger picture

The best product teams distill complex problems and user needs into delightful solutions. Feature-driven design will help you tackle specific customer requests, but outcome-driven design will help you bridge the gap between features and outcomes to make sure that the features you build are not only incredibly meaningful to your customers, but also critical at driving wider success for your organization.
